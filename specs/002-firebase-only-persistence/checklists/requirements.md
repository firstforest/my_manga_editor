# Specification Quality Checklist: Firebase-Only Persistence Migration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results - Iteration 1

### Content Quality Review
âœ… **PASS**: The specification focuses on what needs to happen (data persistence, offline work, migration) and why (creative workflow, data safety).

âœ… **PASS**: All content is written from a user/business perspective focusing on value delivery.

âœ… **PASS**: Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders, explaining concepts in user-friendly terms.

âœ… **PASS**: All mandatory sections (User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements, Success Criteria) are present and complete.

### Requirement Completeness Review
âœ… **PASS**: No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present in the spec.

âœ… **PASS**: All 13 functional requirements are specific, testable, and unambiguous. Each can be verified through testing.

âœ… **PASS**: All 7 success criteria include measurable metrics (time, percentages, counts).

ðŸ”§ **FIXED - SC-005**: Changed from "Code complexity is reduced by at least 30% as measured by removal of Drift-specific code and dependencies" to "Development and maintenance effort is reduced by at least 30% through simplified architecture" - now technology-agnostic.

âœ… **PASS**: Each user story has detailed acceptance scenarios with Given-When-Then format.

âœ… **PASS**: Six edge cases identified covering offline scenarios, sync conflicts, migration failures, and service availability.

âœ… **PASS**: Scope is clearly defined with three prioritized user stories and 13 specific functional requirements.

ðŸ”§ **FIXED - Assumptions**: Added comprehensive Assumptions section with 7 documented assumptions about Firebase capabilities, performance, data compatibility, authentication, and storage.

### Feature Readiness Review
âœ… **PASS**: Functional requirements map to acceptance scenarios in user stories.

âœ… **PASS**: Three user stories cover the complete migration journey (persistence, offline, migration).

âœ… **PASS**: Success criteria align with user story outcomes.

ðŸ”§ **FIXED - Requirements**: Reframed all functional requirements to focus on capabilities rather than technologies. Added a note acknowledging Firebase is the explicit implementation choice while keeping requirements technology-agnostic.

## Validation Results - Iteration 2

All checklist items now pass validation:

âœ… All content quality items pass
âœ… All requirement completeness items pass
âœ… All feature readiness items pass

## Validation Results - Iteration 3 (After Scope Reduction)

**Change**: User Story 3 (migration functionality) removed per user request.

### Updates Made:
- âœ… Removed User Story 3 - Seamless Migration from Existing Data
- âœ… Removed migration-related functional requirements (FR-006 through FR-010)
- âœ… Removed migration-related success criterion (SC-002 on migration success)
- âœ… Removed migration-related edge cases
- âœ… Removed migration-related assumption (A-003)
- âœ… Renumbered remaining requirements for consistency
- âœ… Updated feature note to reflect "replacing" rather than "migrating from"

### Final Counts:
- **User Stories**: 2 (P1: Data Persistence, P2: Offline Work)
- **Functional Requirements**: 8 (reduced from 13)
- **Success Criteria**: 6 (reduced from 7)
- **Assumptions**: 6 (reduced from 7)
- **Edge Cases**: 6 (migration-related removed, first-time user added)

All checklist items still pass with simplified scope.

## Summary

**Status**: âœ… **READY FOR PLANNING**

The specification is complete, simplified, and ready for the next phase. The scope now focuses on:

1. âœ… Core cloud persistence with offline support
2. âœ… Automatic synchronization and conflict resolution
3. âœ… Clean implementation without migration concerns

Migration functionality has been removed, simplifying the implementation to focus purely on Firebase-based persistence with offline capabilities. Users will start fresh with the new storage system.

The spec provides a clear foundation for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify` if further refinement is needed.
