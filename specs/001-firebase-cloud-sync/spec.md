l# Feature Specification: Firebase Cloud Sync with Google Authentication

**Feature Branch**: `001-firebase-cloud-sync`
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "現在DBに保存している内容をFirebaseを使ってどこからでも共有できるようにしたいです。ユーザー管理も同時に行ってください。ログインはGoogleアカウントだけまずできればよいです"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Sign In and Access Existing Data (Priority: P1)

A manga creator wants to sign into the application with their Google account to access their work from any device.

**Why this priority**: Authentication is the foundation for all cloud functionality. Without it, no data can be synced or associated with users.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by signing in with a Google account and verifying the user session is established. Delivers immediate value by enabling user identity management.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user is not signed in, **When** they click "Sign in with Google", **Then** they are redirected to Google sign-in and successfully authenticated
2. **Given** the user has signed in previously, **When** they open the app, **Then** they are automatically signed in with their previous session
3. **Given** the user is signed in, **When** they click "Sign out", **Then** they are signed out and local data remains accessible
4. **Given** the user signs in for the first time, **When** authentication completes, **Then** a new user profile is created in the system

### User Story 2 - Sync Local Data to Cloud (Priority: P2)

A manga creator has created manga projects on their desktop and wants to upload them to the cloud so they can access them from their laptop.

**Why this priority**: This enables the core value proposition - accessing data from anywhere. Depends on authentication (P1) being functional.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating manga data while signed in, verifying it uploads to cloud storage, and checking that sync status is visible to the user. Delivers value by enabling cross-device access.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user is signed in and creates a new manga, **When** they save it, **Then** the manga is stored both locally and synced to the cloud
2. **Given** the user is signed in with existing local mangas, **When** they trigger sync, **Then** all local data is uploaded to their cloud storage
3. **Given** the user modifies an existing manga page, **When** they save the changes, **Then** the updated data is synced to the cloud
4. **Given** the user is offline, **When** they create or modify manga data, **Then** changes are queued and synced automatically when connection is restored
5. **Given** the user has sync in progress, **When** they view the manga list, **Then** they can see sync status (syncing, synced, pending, error) for each manga

### User Story 3 - Access Cloud Data on New Device (Priority: P3)

A manga creator signs into the application on a new device and wants to see all their manga projects that were created on other devices.

**Why this priority**: This completes the cross-device workflow but requires both authentication (P1) and sync (P2) to be functional first.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by signing in on a fresh installation and verifying that cloud data downloads and displays correctly. Delivers value by enabling true multi-device workflows.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user signs in on a new device, **When** authentication completes, **Then** their cloud manga data is automatically downloaded and displayed
2. **Given** the user has both local and cloud data, **When** they sign in, **Then** cloud data takes priority and overwrites local data, with a warning notification shown to the user before sync begins
3. **Given** the user downloads cloud data, **When** they open a manga, **Then** all pages, dialogues, and memos are fully accessible
4. **Given** the user has limited storage space, **When** downloading cloud data, **Then** they can see download progress and cancel if needed

### User Story 4 - Multi-Device Real-Time Collaboration (Priority: P4)

A manga creator is working on their desktop and wants to continue editing the same manga on their tablet, seeing their latest changes immediately.

**Why this priority**: This is an enhancement that provides convenience but is not essential for the core multi-device access use case.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by editing data on one device and verifying it appears on another device within a reasonable timeframe. Delivers enhanced user experience for active users.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user has the app open on two devices, **When** they save a change on device A, **Then** device B reflects the change within 30-60 seconds through periodic sync checks
2. **Given** the user is editing on device A, **When** they make unsaved changes and device B also modifies the same manga, **Then** the system prevents data loss through lock-based editing where only one device can edit a manga at a time, with other devices showing read-only mode until the lock is released

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the user signs in but has no internet connection after authentication?
- How does the system handle partial sync failures (some manga sync successfully, others fail)?
- What happens when cloud storage quota is exceeded?
- How does the system handle corrupt data downloaded from the cloud?
- What happens when a user signs out while sync is in progress?
- How does the system handle very large manga projects (100+ pages) during sync?
- What happens if Google authentication service is temporarily unavailable?
- How does the system handle users deleting data on one device while offline on another device?
- What happens when a user signs in with a different Google account on the same device?

- **SC-004**: Users can continue working offline without any loss of functionality for local data access
- **SC-005**: Sync success rate exceeds 99% for normal network conditions
- **SC-006**: Users can create, edit, and delete manga projects seamlessly across at least 3 different devices
- **SC-007**: Zero data loss occurs during sync operations under normal conditions
- **SC-008**: 95% of users successfully sync their first manga project without requiring support
- **SC-009**: Edit lock acquisition completes in under 2 seconds when manga is available
- **SC-010**: Users are notified within 5 seconds when attempting to edit a locked manga

## Assumptions

- Users have stable internet connectivity for cloud sync operations (mobile data or WiFi)
- Users have valid Google accounts for authentication
- Average manga projects contain 10-50 pages with moderate rich text content
- Users typically work on 1-5 manga projects concurrently
- Cloud storage service maintains 99.9% uptime
- Sync conflicts are relatively rare due to single-user workflows (most users don't edit the same manga on multiple devices simultaneously)
- Users understand the distinction between local-only data (when signed out) and synced data (when signed in)
- Initial implementation focuses on single-user scenarios; multi-user collaboration is out of scope
- Users accept that cloud data is authoritative and local data may be overwritten when signing in on devices with existing local data
- 30-60 second sync delay is acceptable for multi-device workflows, immediate real-time sync is not required
- Lock-based editing is acceptable for preventing conflicts, with users understanding only one device can edit a manga at a time
- Most users work on one device at a time or alternate between devices sequentially rather than simultaneously
- Edit lock expiration (e.g., 5-10 minutes of inactivity) is sufficient to handle abandoned sessions

## Dependencies

- Google Cloud Platform account and Firebase project configuration
- OAuth 2.0 client credentials for Google Sign-In
- Cloud storage service with adequate quotas for expected user base
- Network connectivity for cloud operations
- Platform-specific authentication libraries compatible with Flutter

## Out of Scope

- Authentication methods other than Google Sign-In (Apple, Facebook, email/password)
- Real-time collaborative editing with multiple simultaneous users
- Version history or undo/redo for cloud synced changes
- Selective sync (choosing which manga to sync vs keeping local-only)
- Data export to external cloud services (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.)
- Admin console for user management
- Data migration tools for existing users
- Offline-first architecture optimizations beyond basic queuing
- Advanced conflict resolution UI
