# Specification Quality Checklist: Firebase Cloud Sync with Google Authentication

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Clarification Resolution

All 3 clarification questions were successfully resolved:

1. **Data Merge Strategy** (User Story 3): Cloud data takes priority, with warning notification before overwriting local data
2. **Real-Time Sync Delay** (User Story 4): 30-60 second periodic sync checks
3. **Concurrent Edit Conflict Resolution** (User Story 4): Lock-based editing with read-only mode on other devices

**Updated Functional Requirements**: Added FR-013 through FR-015 for clarified behaviors, plus FR-020, FR-021, FR-026, FR-027 for lock management
**Updated Success Criteria**: SC-003 updated to 30-60 seconds, added SC-009 and SC-010 for lock performance
**Updated Key Entities**: Added "Edit Lock" entity
**Updated Assumptions**: Added 5 assumptions reflecting clarified decisions

## Status

âœ… **SPECIFICATION COMPLETE AND READY FOR PLANNING**

The specification passes all quality checks and is ready for the next phase. Proceed with:
- `/speckit.plan` to create the implementation plan
- `/speckit.clarify` if additional questions arise (though all current questions are resolved)
