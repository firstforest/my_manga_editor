# Tasks: Firebase Cloud Storage

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-firebase-cloud-storage/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/repository-api.md

**Tests**: Tests are NOT explicitly requested in the spec - focusing on implementation only.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Flutter project structure: `lib/`, `test/` at repository root
- Firebase config: `firebase/` at repository root

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Firebase project setup and dependency installation

- [X] T001 Create Firebase project in console and enable Firestore + Authentication (Email/Password provider)
- [X] T002 Install Firebase CLI and FlutterFire CLI, run `flutterfire configure` to generate lib/firebase_options.dart
- [X] T003 Add Firebase dependencies to pubspec.yaml (firebase_core, firebase_auth, cloud_firestore, connectivity_plus)
- [X] T004 Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core Firebase initialization and data models that ALL user stories depend on

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T005 Initialize Firebase in lib/main.dart with `Firebase.initializeApp()` and configure Firestore offline persistence
- [X] T006 [P] Update Manga model in lib/models/manga.dart with @TimestampConverter and Firestore serialization
- [X] T007 [P] Update MangaPage model in lib/models/manga.dart with @DeltaConverter for Quill Delta storage
- [X] T008 [P] Create DeltaConverter class in lib/models/manga.dart for Quill Delta JSON conversion
- [X] T009 [P] Create TimestampConverter class in lib/models/manga.dart for Firestore Timestamp conversion
- [X] T010 Run `dart run build_runner build -d` to generate Freezed and JSON serialization code
- [X] T011 Create Firestore security rules in firestore.rules with user isolation and field validation
- [X] T012 Deploy Firestore security rules with `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

- [ ] T072 [US4] Implement Drift database cleanup after successful migration verification

**Checkpoint**: Migration works - existing users can move from Drift to Firestore without losing data

---

## Phase 7: User Story 5 - Data Privacy and Security (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Ensure manga content is private and secure with proper access control

**Independent Test**: Attempt to access another user's data through various means, verify access is denied

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 2 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational - Authentication is PREREQUISITE for all other stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational + US2 - Cloud sync requires authentication
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational + US2 + US1 - Offline sync builds on cloud sync
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on Foundational + US2 + US1 - Migration requires Firestore repository
- **User Story 5 (Phase 7)**: Depends on Foundational + US2 + US1 - Security tests require data in Firestore
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 2 (Authentication) - P1**: BLOCKS all other stories - must complete first
- **User Story 1 (Cloud Sync) - P1**: Depends on US2 - BLOCKS US3, US4, US5
- **User Story 3 (Offline) - P2**: Depends on US2 + US1 - Can proceed after US1
- **User Story 4 (Migration) - P2**: Depends on US2 + US1 - Can proceed in parallel with US3
- **User Story 5 (Security) - P3**: Depends on US2 + US1 - Can proceed in parallel with US3/US4

### Within Each User Story

- Foundational: Models and converters before repository
- US2: Repository before UI pages before navigation
- US1: Repository methods before providers before UI updates
- US3: Status models before providers before UI widgets
- US4: Migrator class before dialog UI before integration
- US5: Security rules before deployment before testing

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: All tasks are sequential (Firebase setup steps)

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**:
- T006, T007, T008, T009 (model updates) can run in parallel
- T011 (security rules) can run in parallel with model work

**Phase 3 (User Story 2)**:
- T013, T014, T015 (auth repository and providers) can run in parallel
- T017, T018, T019 (auth UI pages) can run in parallel after T016

**Phase 4 (User Story 1)**:
- T023-T037 (repository methods) must be sequential (same file)
- T038, T039 (providers) can run in parallel after repository complete

**Phase 5 (User Story 3)**:
- T048, T049 (status enum and connectivity) can run in parallel
- T053, T055 (UI widgets) can run in parallel after T052

**Phase 6 (User Story 4)**:
- T059, T060 (status enum and migrator class) can run in parallel

**Phase 7 (User Story 5)**:
- All security rule enhancements are in same file (sequential)

**Phase 8 (Polish)**:
- T084, T085 (documentation and logging) can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Cloud Sync)

```bash
# After repository methods complete, launch provider tasks in parallel:
Agent: "Create Riverpod providers in lib/firebase/firestore/firestore_manga_repository.dart"
Agent: "Create stream providers in lib/firebase/firestore/manga_providers.dart"

# After providers generated, UI updates can proceed in different files:
# (These depend on providers but touch different UI files)
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 2 + User Story 1)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (Firebase configuration)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (models, converters, base infrastructure)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 2 (authentication system)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 1 (cloud synchronization)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test cross-device sync with authentication
6. Deploy/demo if ready - this is the minimal viable cloud storage feature

**Rationale**: US2 + US1 together provide the core value proposition - users can sync manga across devices with secure accounts.

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test authentication independently
3. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test cloud sync independently ‚Üí **Deploy/Demo (MVP!)**
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test offline mode independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test migration independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test security independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Complete User Story 2 (authentication) together - BLOCKS everything
3. Once US2 done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (cloud sync)
   - Once US1 done:
     - Developer B: User Story 3 (offline)
     - Developer C: User Story 4 (migration)
     - Developer D: User Story 5 (security)

**Note**: US2 and US1 must be sequential, but US3/US4/US5 can proceed in parallel after US1.

---

## Summary Statistics

**Total Tasks**: 93 tasks

**Tasks per User Story**:
- Setup (Phase 1): 4 tasks
- Foundational (Phase 2): 8 tasks
- User Story 2 (Authentication): 10 tasks
- User Story 1 (Cloud Sync): 25 tasks
- User Story 3 (Offline): 11 tasks
- User Story 4 (Migration): 14 tasks
- User Story 5 (Security): 11 tasks
- Polish (Phase 8): 10 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities Identified**:
- Phase 2: 5 tasks can run in parallel
- Phase 3: 6 tasks can run in parallel (3 repo + 3 UI)
- Phase 4: 2 providers can run in parallel
- Phase 5: 3 tasks can run in parallel
- Phase 6: 2 tasks can run in parallel
- Phase 8: 2 tasks can run in parallel

**Suggested MVP Scope**: Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 (US2) + Phase 4 (US1) = **47 tasks**

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- US2: Create account, sign out, sign in, verify persistence
- US1: Create manga on Device A, view on Device B with formatting intact
- US3: Offline edits auto-sync when online
- US4: Drift data migrates to Firestore with 100% fidelity
- US5: User A cannot access User B's data

**Format Validation**: ‚úÖ All tasks follow checklist format with checkboxes, task IDs, [P] markers where applicable, [Story] labels for user story phases, and file paths in descriptions.

---

## Notes

- No tests included (not requested in spec)
- All tasks have explicit file paths
- [P] markers indicate parallelizable tasks in different files
- [Story] labels map tasks to user stories for traceability
- Each user story is independently testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Security rules deployed twice: basic in Phase 2, enhanced in Phase 7
