# Tasks: Firebase-Only Persistence Migration

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-firebase-only-persistence/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/repository_api.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Tests are NOT included in this task list as they were not explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

**Design Decision**: Delta objects are managed by **ID reference** to minimize domain model changes. Repository layer converts between Firestore embedded deltas and in-memory DeltaId cache.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Flutter project structure: `lib/` at repository root
- Test files: `test/` at repository root
- Paths assume Flutter cross-platform application structure

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Offline Work Continuity (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Enable users to continue working on manga projects without internet connection, with automatic synchronization when reconnecting

**Independent Test**: Disconnect from internet, create/edit manga content, verify changes are stored locally, reconnect and confirm data synchronizes to cloud

- [ ] T061 Run flutter analyze to verify no compilation errors

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently - offline editing with automatic sync

---

## Phase 5: Data Migration from Drift to Firebase

**Purpose**: Migrate existing Drift SQLite data to Firestore without data loss

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: This phase requires Drift dependencies to remain until migration is complete

- [ ] T062 Create DriftToFirebaseMigration service in lib/service/migration/drift_to_firebase_migration.dart (migrate, verify, fetchDelta methods)
- [ ] T063 Implement migrate method in lib/service/migration/drift_to_firebase_migration.dart (fetch Drift data, convert to CloudManga/CloudMangaPage with embedded deltas, upload to Firestore)
- [ ] T064 Implement verify method in lib/service/migration/drift_to_firebase_migration.dart (compare Drift count vs Firestore count, throw on mismatch)
- [ ] T065 Add migration check in lib/main.dart (_checkMigrationNeeded function to detect existing Drift database)
- [ ] T066 Create MigrationScreen in lib/feature/migration/migration_screen.dart (show progress UI, run migration, handle errors)
- [ ] T067 Update MyApp in lib/main.dart (conditional rendering: show MigrationScreen if needsMigration, else show normal app)
- [ ] T068 Add migration error handling in lib/feature/migration/migration_screen.dart (show retry button on failure, preserve Drift DB until verified)
- [ ] T069 Test migration with sample data (create test manga in Drift, run migration, verify in Firestore and delta cache)

**Checkpoint**: Migration complete - existing user data successfully migrated to Firestore with delta cache populated

---

- [ ] T071 Run flutter pub get to remove Drift packages
- [ ] T072 Delete Drift database service directory lib/service/database/ (database.dart, database.g.dart, model/)
- [ ] T073 Remove all Drift imports from codebase (search for 'package:drift', 'package:drift_flutter', remove unused imports)
- [ ] T074 Remove sync queue models in lib/service/firebase/model/ (sync_queue_entry.dart, sync_queue_entry.freezed.dart, sync_queue_entry.g.dart if exists)
- [ ] T075 Remove SyncStateNotifier in lib/feature/manga/provider/ (sync_state_notifier.dart, sync_state_notifier.g.dart if exists)
- [ ] T076 Evaluate and remove edit lock manager if not needed in lib/service/firebase/lock_manager.dart (or keep for Phase 2 enhancement)
- [ ] T077 Run dart run build_runner build -d --delete-conflicting-outputs to clean up generated files
- [ ] T078 Run flutter analyze to verify no compilation errors
- [ ] T079 Run flutter test to verify all tests pass with new architecture
- [ ] T080 [P] Update CLAUDE.md documentation to reflect Firebase-only architecture with Delta ID reference pattern
- [ ] T081 [P] Add performance monitoring in lib/feature/manga/repository/manga_repository.dart (log Firestore operation durations, delta cache hit/miss rates)
- [ ] T082 Run quickstart.md validation (follow all steps from quickstart.md to verify implementation)
- [ ] T083 Test offline editing behavior (enable airplane mode, edit content via saveDelta, verify queued for sync, disable airplane mode, verify sync)
- [ ] T084 Test delta cache persistence across app restarts (verify deltas reload from Firestore on app launch)
- [ ] T085 Test across target platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux at minimum for desktop app)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion - Core persistence with Delta cache
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on User Story 1 completion - Builds on persistence with offline sync
- **Data Migration (Phase 5)**: Depends on User Story 1 completion - Can run in parallel with User Story 2
- **Cleanup (Phase 6)**: Depends on successful Data Migration - Final step

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Depends on User Story 1 - Adds offline/sync capabilities to existing persistence

### Within Each User Story

- **User Story 1 (P1)**:
  - Delta cache implementation (T016-T021) must complete first
  - Conversion extensions (T022-T025) can run in parallel after cache exists
  - Repository core (T026-T042) builds on cache and conversions
  - Provider updates (T043-T046) depend on repository completion
  - UI updates (T047-T052) depend on provider completion

- **User Story 2 (P2)**:
  - Repository sync methods (T053-T055) sequential (building on each other)
  - Provider creation (T056) depends on repository methods
  - UI updates (T058-T061) depend on provider completion

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: T003 and T004 can run in parallel (independent setup tasks)
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: T006-T011 can run in parallel (creating different models/files), T013-T014 can run in parallel
- **User Story 1 Delta Cache**: T017-T020 methods can be implemented in parallel (different methods in same class)
- **User Story 1 Conversions**: T022-T025 can run in parallel (extension methods in different sections)
- **Cleanup (Phase 6)**: T080 and T081 can run in parallel (documentation and monitoring are independent)

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 Delta Cache Methods

```bash
# Launch all delta cache method implementations together:
Task: "Implement storeDelta method in lib/feature/manga/repository/delta_cache.dart"
Task: "Implement getDelta method in lib/feature/manga/repository/delta_cache.dart"
Task: "Implement getDeltaStream method in lib/feature/manga/repository/delta_cache.dart"
Task: "Implement updateDelta method in lib/feature/manga/repository/delta_cache.dart"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (with Delta cache pattern)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Data persists with Delta IDs ‚úÖ
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Offline editing with sync ‚úÖ
4. Run Data Migration ‚Üí Migrate existing users ‚Üí Migration complete ‚úÖ
5. Cleanup ‚Üí Remove Drift, finalize ‚Üí Production ready ‚úÖ

### Delta Cache Strategy

**Cache Lifecycle**:
1. **App Launch**: Cache starts empty
2. **Data Fetch**: When Manga/MangaPage loaded from Firestore, embedded Deltas stored in cache with auto-generated DeltaIds
3. **Data Edit**: saveDelta() updates cache and syncs embedded Delta to Firestore
4. **App Restart**: Cache cleared, re-populated on next data fetch

**Cache Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Minimal domain model changes (DeltaId remains int)
- ‚úÖ UI layer unchanged (getDeltaStream works as before)
- ‚úÖ Firestore optimization (embedded deltas reduce reads)
- ‚úÖ Offline-first (cache provides instant access)

**Cache Considerations**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Memory usage (all deltas cached in-memory)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Cache invalidation on concurrent edits (handled by Firestore streams)

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Code generation (`dart run build_runner build -d`) required after model changes
- Commit after each logical task group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Migration is one-time operation, can be removed after all users migrated
- **Delta ID pattern**: Repository maintains in-memory cache mapping DeltaId (int) ‚Üî Delta object
- **Firestore structure**: Deltas embedded in CloudManga/CloudMangaPage documents (cost optimization)
- **UI compatibility**: Existing getDeltaStream calls work unchanged with int DeltaId
