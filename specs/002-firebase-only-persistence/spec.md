# Feature Specification: Firebase-Only Persistence Migration

**Feature Branch**: `002-firebase-only-persistence`
**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "実装をシンプルに保ちたいので、Driftの実装を削除しFirebaseによる永続化のみにする。オフライン対応はFirebaseの機能で行う"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Data Persists Across Sessions (Priority: P1)

As a manga creator, I need my work (manga projects, pages, dialogues, memos) to be saved automatically and available when I restart the application, so that I never lose my creative work.

**Why this priority**: This is the core persistence functionality. Without reliable data storage, the application cannot function as a creative tool. All other features depend on data being safely stored and retrieved.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a new manga project with multiple pages and content, closing the application completely, reopening it, and verifying all data is intact and accessible.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user has created a new manga project with pages and content, **When** they close and reopen the application, **Then** all manga projects and their content are displayed exactly as they were before closing
2. **Given** the user is editing a manga page, **When** they add dialogue and memo content, **Then** the content is automatically persisted without requiring manual save actions
3. **Given** the user has multiple manga projects, **When** they navigate between projects, **Then** each project loads with all its pages and content intact

### User Story 2 - Offline Work Continuity (Priority: P2)

As a manga creator, I need to continue working on my projects even when I don't have an internet connection, so that my creative workflow is never interrupted by connectivity issues.

**Why this priority**: Creative work often happens in various locations with varying internet connectivity. While less critical than basic persistence, offline capability ensures the application is usable anywhere.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by disconnecting from the internet, creating/editing manga content, verifying the changes are stored locally, then reconnecting and confirming data synchronizes to the cloud.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user is offline, **When** they create new manga projects or edit existing ones, **Then** all changes are stored locally and the application remains fully functional
2. **Given** the user made changes while offline, **When** they reconnect to the internet, **Then** all offline changes automatically synchronize to the cloud without data loss
3. **Given** the user is offline, **When** they open the application, **Then** they can access all previously downloaded content and continue working

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the user is offline for an extended period (days/weeks) and then reconnects?
- How does the system handle sync conflicts if the user edits the same content on multiple devices while offline?
- How does the system handle partial sync failures (some data syncs, some fails)?
- What happens when the user's cloud storage quota is exceeded?
- How does the system recover if cloud services are temporarily unavailable?
- What happens when a user starts the application for the first time without existing data?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Note**: This feature explicitly requires replacing the current local database with Firebase cloud storage for simplified architecture.

- **FR-001**: System MUST persist all manga project data (metadata, pages, content) to cloud storage
- **FR-002**: System MUST persist all rich text content (Quill Deltas for memos, dialogues, stage directions) with full formatting preservation
- **FR-003**: System MUST enable full application functionality when offline, with local data access
- **FR-004**: System MUST automatically synchronize local changes to cloud storage when internet connection becomes available
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide automatic conflict resolution when the same content is modified on multiple devices while offline
- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users for secure cloud data access
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain the same data access patterns and performance characteristics as the current implementation
- **FR-008**: System MUST support all currently supported platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, Web)

### Key Entities

- **Manga**: Represents a manga project with metadata including project name, page reading direction (left-to-right or right-to-left), and overall idea memo. Serves as the top-level container for all manga content.
- **MangaPage**: Represents individual pages within a manga project, with attributes for page index (ordering), memo content, dialogue content, and stage direction notes. Has a parent-child relationship to Manga.
- **RichTextContent**: Represents formatted text content using Quill Delta JSON format. Used for storing memos, dialogues, and stage directions with full formatting preservation (bold, italic, lists, etc.).

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can access and edit their manga projects within 2 seconds of launching the application (same as current performance)
- **SC-002**: Users can work offline for unlimited duration and all changes synchronize successfully when reconnecting
- **SC-003**: Application startup time improves or remains within 10% of current performance
- **SC-004**: Development and maintenance effort is reduced by at least 30% through simplified architecture
- **SC-005**: Users experience zero data loss incidents related to the new persistence layer in the first 3 months post-deployment
- **SC-006**: Sync conflicts are resolved automatically in 95% of cases without requiring user intervention

## Assumptions

- **A-001**: Firebase services provide adequate performance for real-time manga content editing and retrieval
- **A-002**: Firebase offline persistence can handle the size and complexity of manga project data (rich text, multiple pages)
- **A-003**: Users will authenticate with Firebase (authentication method to be determined in planning phase)
- **A-004**: Firebase storage quotas and pricing are acceptable for the target user base
- **A-005**: Firebase conflict resolution mechanisms are sufficient for manga editing workflows
- **A-006**: Quill Delta JSON format can be stored efficiently in Firebase without structural changes
