# Feature Specification: Firebase Cloud Storage

**Feature Branch**: `001-firebase-cloud-storage`
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Firebaseを利用したデータのクラウド保存機能を追加します。現在のdriftによる実装はそれで置き換えてしまって構いません。"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Cloud Data Synchronization (Priority: P1)

A manga creator works on their plot on their desktop computer in the studio, then continues editing on their laptop at home. All their manga data (titles, pages, dialogues, memos) seamlessly syncs across devices without manual export/import.

**Why this priority**: Core value proposition of cloud storage - enables cross-device workflows which is critical for creators who work in multiple locations.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating manga content on one device, signing in on another device, and verifying all data appears correctly. Delivers immediate value of device continuity.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has created manga data on Device A, **When** user signs in on Device B, **Then** all manga content appears with same page order, text formatting, and metadata
2. **Given** user edits page dialogue on Device A, **When** Device B is online, **Then** Device B reflects the updated dialogue within reasonable time
3. **Given** user creates new manga page on Device A while offline, **When** Device A reconnects to internet, **Then** new page automatically syncs and appears on all other signed-in devices

### User Story 2 - User Authentication and Account Management (Priority: P1)

A manga creator signs up for the application using their email address to create a cloud-backed account. They can sign in on any device to access their manga collection.

**Why this priority**: Authentication is a prerequisite for cloud storage - users need identity management before data can be associated with their account.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by creating account, signing out, signing back in, and verifying account persistence. Delivers value of secure access control.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** new user opens the app, **When** they choose to sign up with email and password, **Then** account is created and they are signed in
2. **Given** user has an account, **When** they sign in with correct credentials on any device, **Then** they access their personal manga data
3. **Given** user has forgotten password, **When** they request password reset, **Then** they receive recovery instructions and can regain access
4. **Given** user wants to sign out, **When** they trigger sign out action, **Then** their local session ends and data is protected

---

### User Story 3 - Offline Work with Auto-Sync (Priority: P2)

A manga creator works on their plot during a train commute without internet connection. All changes are saved locally and automatically sync when connection is restored.

**Why this priority**: Ensures application remains usable without constant connectivity, critical for mobile/portable workflows. Builds on P1 sync infrastructure.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by disabling network, making edits, re-enabling network, and verifying changes sync. Delivers value of uninterrupted creativity.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is offline, **When** they create or edit manga content, **Then** changes are saved locally and queued for sync
2. **Given** user has pending offline changes, **When** connection is restored, **Then** queued changes automatically upload without user intervention
3. **Given** user makes conflicting edits offline on two devices, **When** both reconnect, **Then** system applies last write wins strategy (newest timestamp overwrites older changes)

---

### User Story 4 - Data Migration from Local Storage (Priority: P2)

An existing user with manga data stored locally (Drift database) migrates their content to cloud storage without data loss.

**Why this priority**: Protects existing users' work and enables smooth transition to cloud infrastructure. Required for replacing Drift implementation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating test data in old Drift database, running migration, and verifying all content appears in cloud storage with correct formatting and relationships.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has existing manga data in local Drift database, **When** they complete authentication setup, **Then** system offers to migrate existing data to cloud
2. **Given** user accepts migration offer, **When** migration completes, **Then** all manga titles, pages, deltas, and metadata are preserved in cloud storage
3. **Given** migration fails partway through, **When** error occurs, **Then** local data remains intact and user can retry migration

---

### User Story 5 - Data Privacy and Security (Priority: P3)

A manga creator wants assurance that their unpublished manga content is private and secure, with only them having access to their creative work.

**Why this priority**: Important for user trust but doesn't block core functionality. Security rules implementation follows after basic sync infrastructure.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by attempting to access another user's data through various means and verifying access is denied. Delivers value of privacy assurance.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has private manga content, **When** another user signs in on different account, **Then** they cannot view or modify the first user's manga data
2. **Given** user's data is stored in cloud, **When** transmitted over network, **Then** content is encrypted in transit
3. **Given** user deletes their manga content, **When** deletion completes, **Then** content is permanently removed from cloud storage

### Edge Cases

- What happens when user loses internet connection during active sync (mid-upload)?
- How does system handle extremely large manga collections (hundreds of titles, thousands of pages)?
- What occurs if user reaches cloud storage quota limits?
- How does system behave if user signs in simultaneously on multiple devices and makes rapid edits?
- What happens to local Drift data after successful migration - is it preserved or removed?
- How are rich text Quill Delta formats preserved during cloud sync?
- What happens if user deletes the app without signing out - is data retained in cloud?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST authenticate users via email and password with account creation and sign-in flows
- **FR-002**: System MUST store all manga data (manga metadata, page content, Quill Delta text) in cloud storage associated with user accounts
- **FR-003**: System MUST synchronize manga data bidirectionally between client device and cloud storage
- **FR-004**: System MUST support offline data modification with automatic sync when connection is restored
- **FR-005**: System MUST migrate existing Drift database content to cloud storage without data loss
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve Quill Delta JSON format for all rich text content (memos, dialogues, stage directions) during cloud storage operations
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain referential integrity between manga titles, pages, and delta content in cloud storage
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide user sign-out functionality that clears local session
- **FR-009**: System MUST support password recovery flow for users who forget credentials
- **FR-010**: System MUST isolate each user's manga data so only authenticated owner can access their content
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle concurrent edits across multiple devices for same user account
- **FR-012**: System MUST indicate sync status to user (syncing, synced, offline, error)
- **FR-013**: System MUST preserve manga page ordering during cloud sync operations
- **FR-014**: System MUST retain all manga metadata (name, start page direction, idea memos) during cloud operations

### Key Entities

- **User Account**: Represents authenticated manga creator, owns manga collection, has credentials (email/password), manages sync state across devices
- **Cloud Manga**: Cloud-stored manga title with metadata (name, start page direction, idea memo reference), owned by specific user, contains multiple pages
- **Cloud Manga Page**: Cloud-stored page content within manga (page index, memo/dialogue/stage direction references), maintains order and relationships
- **Cloud Delta**: Cloud-stored Quill Delta JSON for rich text content, referenced by manga metadata and page content fields, preserves formatting
- **Sync Queue**: Local collection of pending changes awaiting upload when offline, automatically processes when online

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can access their manga data on a new device within 30 seconds of signing in
- **SC-002**: System successfully syncs changes across devices within 5 seconds when online
- **SC-003**: Users can work offline and have changes automatically sync when reconnected without manual action
- **SC-004**: 100% of existing Drift database content successfully migrates to cloud storage without data corruption or loss
- **SC-005**: System handles manga collections with up to 100 titles and 1000 total pages without performance degradation
- **SC-006**: 95% of users successfully complete account creation and first sign-in on first attempt
