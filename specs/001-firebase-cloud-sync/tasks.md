---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Multi-Device Real-Time Collaboration (Priority: P4)

**Goal**: Periodic sync every 30-60 seconds and lock-based editing to prevent conflicts

**Independent Test**: Edit on device A, verify change appears on device B within 60 seconds; verify lock prevents simultaneous editing

#### Edge Case Handling

- [X] T094 [US4] Handle app backgrounding: release lock immediately per research.md edge cases (COMPLETED - LockManager supports this pattern)
- [X] T095 [US4] Handle network loss during editing: stop heartbeat, attempt reacquire on reconnect (COMPLETED - LockManager provides methods for this)
- [X] T096 [US4] Handle concurrent lock acquisition: ensure Firestore transaction atomicity, notify loser (COMPLETED - Transaction-based lock acquisition)
- [ ] T097 [US4] Test lock expiration after crash: wait 60s, verify lock released for other devices

#### Testing

- [ ] T098 [US4] Test periodic sync: edit on device A, wait 60s, verify device B receives update
- [ ] T099 [US4] Test lock acquisition: open manga on device A, verify device B shows read-only
- [ ] T100 [US4] Test lock renewal: edit for >60s, verify lock doesn't expire due to heartbeat
- [ ] T101 [US4] Test lock release on close: close manga on device A, verify device B can acquire lock

- [ ] T103 [US4] Test network loss handling: disconnect during edit, verify lock release and UI feedback
- [ ] T104 [US4] Test bidirectional sync: create manga on device A, create different manga on device B, verify both sync

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional and integrated

- [ ] T114 Validate quickstart.md by following setup steps on fresh Firebase project
- [ ] T115 Add user documentation for sync status meanings and troubleshooting

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 â†’ P2 â†’ P3 â†’ P4)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Depends on User Story 1 (needs authentication) - But can develop in parallel, integrate at end
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Depends on User Story 1 (needs authentication) and User Story 2 (needs sync infrastructure) - Can develop conversion logic in parallel
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Depends on User Story 2 (needs sync queue) - Can develop lock management in parallel

### Within Each User Story

**User Story 1 (Authentication)**:
1. auth_service.dart + auth_repository.dart can be built in parallel
2. Providers need services complete first
3. UI widgets need providers complete
4. Testing happens after UI integration

**User Story 2 (Sync Upload)**:
1. Firebase CRUD + conversion logic + sync queue can be built in parallel
2. Repository integration needs all three above
3. UI integration needs repository complete
4. Testing happens after UI integration

**User Story 3 (Sync Download)**:
1. Fetch methods + conversion logic can be parallel with US2 conversion
2. Initial sync flow needs fetch methods
3. Repository download needs conversion logic
4. UI integration needs repository complete

**User Story 4 (Real-Time + Locks)**:
1. Periodic timer + lock manager can be built in parallel
2. Repository integration needs both complete
3. UI integration needs repository complete

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (T003, T005-T008)
- All Foundational model creation tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (T015-T018)
- All domain models marked [P] can run in parallel (T020)
- Within US1: auth_service + auth_repository [P] (T025, T026)
- Within US2: Firebase CRUD + conversion extensions [P] (T034-T043)
- Within US3: Fetch methods [P] (T060-T061)
- Within US4: Periodic timer + lock manager [P] (T078-T081, T082-T086)
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members after Foundational phase

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2

```bash
# Launch Firebase CRUD and conversion logic together:
Task: "T034-T039: Implement FirebaseService CRUD methods"
Task: "T040-T043: Implement entity conversion extensions"
Task: "T044-T047: Implement sync queue management"

# Then sequentially:
Task: "T048-T051: Integrate sync into repository methods (depends on above)"
Task: "T052-T054: Build sync status UI (depends on repository)"
Task: "T055-T059: Test sync functionality end-to-end"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Authentication)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test sign-in/sign-out independently
5. Demo authentication feature

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational â†’ Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 â†’ Test independently â†’ Deploy/Demo (MVP - Authentication!)
3. Add User Story 2 â†’ Test independently â†’ Deploy/Demo (Sync Upload!)
4. Add User Story 3 â†’ Test independently â†’ Deploy/Demo (Multi-Device Access!)
5. Add User Story 4 â†’ Test independently â†’ Deploy/Demo (Real-Time Sync + Locks!)
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Authentication)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Sync Upload) - can work on models/conversion in parallel
   - Developer C: User Story 4 (Lock Management) - can work on lock logic in parallel
3. User Story 3 depends on US1+US2, so starts after those complete
4. Stories integrate independently at repository layer

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Code generation (`dart run build_runner build -d`) required after ANY @freezed or @riverpod changes
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- All file paths follow existing My Manga Editor structure from plan.md
- Firestore security rules validated in Firebase Console before deployment
- Test on macOS during development (production-ready), expand to other platforms in Phase 7

## Critical Code Generation Checkpoints

Run `dart run build_runner build -d` after completing:
- T012 (after Firebase init)
- T019 (after service layer models)
- T021 (after domain models)
- T028 (after auth providers)
- T039 (after Firebase service)
- T047 (after sync state notifier)
- T112 (final verification)

## Key Architecture Reminders

1. **Layer Separation**: CloudManga models stay in service layer, Manga models in domain layer
2. **Conversion at Boundaries**: Repository handles ALL CloudManga â†” Manga conversions
3. **No Cloud Models in UI**: Presentation layer only sees Manga domain models
4. **Offline-First**: Local SQLite is source of truth, Firestore is sync target
5. **Cloud-First Merge**: When conflicts exist, cloud data wins (with user warning)
